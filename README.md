# 🎵 Multo Terminal Lyrics

A simple Python script that animates the lyrics of the song **"Multo"** by *Cup of Joe* line by line in your terminal. The goal is to simulate a dramatic, slow-type effect, perfect for emotional CLI performances. 😢💻🎶

## 🚀 Demo

```bash
$ python multo.py
'Di mo ba ako lilisanin?
Hindi pa ba sapat pagpapahirap sa 'kin? (Damdamin ko)
Hindi na ba ma-mamamayapa?
Hindi na ba ma-mamamayapa?
Hindi na makalaya
Dinadalaw mo 'ko bawat gabi
```
🛠️ How It Works
The script uses:

time.sleep() for delays

sys.stdout.write() + flush() for real-time character animation

if __name__ == "__main__" block for clean execution
